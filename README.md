# MyMIDI
Read about this project on [Substack](https://alshival.substack.com/p/a-coders-guide-to-midi-driven-hotkeys).

Code to use MIDI buttons as hot keys. Each button can be assigned a different task. This code is meant to serve as a sort of template, as much of it will be dependent on your prefered MIDI device and what tasks you wish to assign each button.
Originally, I had written this program in Python, but it was a resource hog, so it as ported over to Rust. MyMIDI was written for the Akai MPK Mini Play and must be adapted for your device.
